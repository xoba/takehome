# takehome
a suggestion for take-home data science project

## description

i like to get a sense for how data 
scientists think about what they
do, and the ways they get it done.

i've loved [lasso](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/lasso/lasso.pdf)
and [gps](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~jhf/ftp/GPSpub.pdf)
ever since
i learned about them. first lasso,
then when gps came to the rescue
as a simple and efficient implementation.

show me a simple implementation of
the gps inplementation from scratch as applied
to the prostate cancer data in the lasso
paper. do it in a way that
reliably allows
me to run it and see the same
results you do, for instance 
via docker or some other
cross-platform technique. let me know
your thought process and what you
feel is important to document.
